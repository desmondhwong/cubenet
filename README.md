* font built from [11 nets of the cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube#/media/File:The_11_cubic_nets.svg) on a 9x9 grid (900x900 units)
* was studying rubiks cube, thinking about [spider fly problem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpiderandFlyProblem.html)
* made for cubeOS, a kind of Rubik's solver interface, cube coordinate language
* the edges of the cube run along infinity symbol "rivers", font is starting point for a language to map those pathways
* those pathways can then be analog mapped to neurons, race tracks, procedurally generated map worlds, etc etc.
* also interested in seeing organic [desire paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) form across this strict square grid
* all that being said, please use for anything! made for fun

* c`#` glyph notation, up to 9 digits, e.g. `c999999999`
* opentype `liga` feature, e.g. `sub one one by c11;`
* [font within a font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_story)
* "reserve" a block of numbers for a font "subset", e.g. replace 1–26 slots with 100–126
* userid as glyph `c#`; [special.fish](https://special.fish/) philosophy
* 9/9 "time signature", glyph repetition every 9 beats; glyphic [orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude#/media/File:Orders_of_magnitude_(english_annotations).png)

possible next steps:
* python script for all 4-net "star" configurations for 11 nets: Permutations with repetition (n=11, r=4) Using Items: a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k List has 14641 entries. {a,a,a,a} {a,a,a,b} {a,a,a,c} {a,a,a,d} {a,a,a,e} {a,a,a,f} {a,a,a,g} {a,a,a,h} {a,a,a,i} {a,a,a,j} {a,a,a,k} {a,a,b,a} …
* webhosting/social network? glyphspace as website/avatar
* typeface as [kifu](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Kifu) or midi notation; musical playback
* "living" typeface: [calculator logic within typeface](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Pi_calculator)
